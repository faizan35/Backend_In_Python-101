## Topics

### Python Basics

1.  **[Ex-1-Variables-and-Data-Types](./Exercises-01/Ex-1-Variables-and-Data-Types.py)**

    **Task:**

    - Create a program that stores the user's name, age, and height in variables. Print a message using these variables, like "Hello, [Name]! You are [Age] years old and [Height] meters tall."

2.  **[Ex-2-Strings-and-Operators.py](./Exercises-01/Ex-2-Strings-and-Operators.py)**

    **Task:**

    - Write a program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart. Use variables for item prices and quantities, and print the total cost.

### Control Flow

3.  **If Statements:**

    - Task: Develop a program that asks the user to input their exam score. Based on the score, the program should print "Pass" if the score is 60 or above, and "Fail" otherwise.

4.  **Loops:**

    - Task: Create a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. Allow the user to input the number of terms and print the sequence.

### Functions

5.  **Defining Functions:**

    - Task: Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. Define a function `calculate_circle_area` that takes the radius as a parameter and returns the area.

6.  **Parameters and Return Values:**

    - Task: Develop a program that converts a given temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. Use a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` with a parameter for Celsius temperature and return the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature.

7.  **Lambda Functions:**

    - Task: Create a program that uses a lambda function to calculate the square of each number in a list of integers. Print the original list and the squared values.
